    """The forces determine the path of the atoms in a trajectory.

    You can use this class to analyze the forces acting on the atoms. The forces
    are the first derivative of the DFT total energy. The forces being small is
    an important criterion for the convergence of a relaxation calculation. The
    size of the forces is also related to the maximal time step in MD simulations.
    When you choose a too large time step, the forces become large and the atoms
    may move too much in a single step leading to an unstable trajectory. You can
    use this class to visualize the forces in a trajectory or read the values to
    analyze them numerically.

    Examples
    --------
    Let us create some example data so that we can illustrate how to use this class.
    Of course you can also use your own VASP calculation data if you have it available.

    >>> from py4vasp import demo
    >>> calculation = demo.calculation(path)

    If you access the forces, the result will depend on the steps that you selected
    with the [] operator. Without any selection the results from the final step will be
    used.

    >>> calculation.force.number_steps()
    1

    To select the results for all steps, you don't specify the array boundaries.

    >>> calculation.force[:].number_steps()
    4

    You can also select specific steps or a subset of steps as follows

    >>> calculation.force[3].number_steps()
    1
    >>> calculation.force[1:4].number_steps()
